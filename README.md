# ChatBot

In this Python project with source code, I built a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot was trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. I used a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then I will give a random response from the list of responses.

This Chatbot worked really well, Can be Trained Easily and also no nonsensical responses
